Datasets were chosen.
Basic structure of moduals was written.
Basic user interface for the index page was written.
First selection function was made in selections.py and linked to index.py.
Project file for the Newcastle dataset was made
secondary_selection function which lets user choose whether they do "Column Statistics" or "Graph Plotting" with the chosen data was written in selection.py and linked to Newcastle_1.py. 
secondary_selection function will be linked to the modules of other datasets, negating the need to re-write the same function multiple times. 


20:29 23/02/2018

Project files for the Northern Ireland dataset, and the Hawaii dataset were made. Linked secondary_selection function from selection.py to NI_1.py and Hawaii_1.py. 


09:59 24/02/2018

Changed Newcastle from a function to a class, accordingly wrote a main() function for it in Newcastle_1.py.
Moved secondary_selection from selections.py to s_selection.py, because a modual can only be loaded once.
Wrote newcastle_selections.py which contains two functions with the basic user interface and options for if the user wants to do some statistcal analysis or plot graphs.

16:22 25/02/2018

Added @classmethods to Newcastle class. @classmethods created were column_or_graph , column_selection, graph_plotting.
Program was debugged and additional annotations were added.
Program also now works. 
ColumnCalculations class was made for Newcastle dataset as well, allowing for column manipulations. 

19:36 01/03/2018

ColumnCalculations class was further developed adding a method which calculated the total amount of electricity for each year and displayed it in a new row at the bottom of the columns.

14:22 03/03/2018

ColumnCaclculations class was further expanded adding a method to find the max electricity used each year.
Newcastle class was revamped, and actually kinda works now, almost, but not quite.
Newcastle's two choice interfaces were put into one python file instead of using two files, it just seemed to be nicer that way. 
Newcastle's main function was also revamped, it's much more easier to read and reletively functional.
Further annotations added.

23:32 03/03/2018

ColumnCaclculations class was completed and imported to Newcastle_1.py as a class.
ColumnCalculations class methods are called by Newcastle class methods. 
GraphPlotting class was made and completed and imported into Newcastle_1.py as a class
GraphPlotting class methods are used called by Newcastle class methods.
Newcastle class was finished as well, all methods are complete and bug free.
Newcastle_1.py main() function was debugged and works with no issues now.
Everything for Newcastle dataset is complete.

00:05 04/03/2018

Further annotations added.

19:57 04/03/2018

Hawaii dataset was changed out for a plastic bag use in England dataset. All corresponding files were renamed accordingly.
Interfaces for Plastic Bag dataset are stared.

10:15 05/03/2018

Revisited the Newcastle class and dataset after rereading the requirments. Methods in the ColumnCalculation class were redone: merging basic statistics into one method, total remained unchanged, difference per month between 2011 and 2017 was added, and percent differnce between 2012 and 2013 per month added.
Interfaces were updated accordingly, Newcastle class was updated accordingly.

19:36 05/03/2018

ColumnCalculation class was began in bag_cc.py. Merging basic statistics method, calculating the total number of plastic bags method was written, and net vs donation method made as well. 
ColumnCalculation class was intergrated into Bag in Bay_1.py.
Further annotations have been added. 

13:37 06/03/2018

ColumnCalculation class was finished in bag_cc.py. Vat caluclation was done, and integerated in Bag in Bag_1.py.
GraphPlotting class in bag_cc.py was started, first two methods complete: pie chart, showing donators v non-donators and a bar chart of bags made. 
The total plastic bags method in ColumnCalculation was improved, adding suppuression to scientific notation, displaying numbers as integers.
Further annotations were added.

17:47 08/03/2018

GraphPlotting class in bay_cc.py was completed and further intgerated into the Bag class in Bay_1.py. 
ni_cc.py was started for the NI dataset.
Basic structure of ni_cc.py and NI_1.py were done.
Further annotations were added.

15:15 10/03/2018

Basic statistics were done for NI in ni_cc.py, and other methods were began.
Further annotations were added.

17:56 12/03/2018

Project and paperwork completed.
